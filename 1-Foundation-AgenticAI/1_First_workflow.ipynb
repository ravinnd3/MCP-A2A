       "- Next term: 56\n",
       "  - Sequence 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42 corresponds to n(n+1); for n=7: 7×8=56.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Next term: 129\n",
       "  - 3, 5, 9, 17, 33, 65 = 2^n + 1 (n=1,2,3, ...). Next is 2^7 + 1 = 128 + 1 = 129.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Next term: 49\n",
       "  - These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, next is 7^2 = 49.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Complete the letter sequence: B (wrap around after Z)\n",
       "  - Positions: A(1), C(3), F(6), J(10), O(15), U(21); increments +2, +3, +4, +5, +6; next +7 → 28 → wraps to B.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Distinct arrangements for LEVEL: 30\n",
       "  - Letters: L×2, E×2, V×1 → 5!/(2!2!) = 120/4 = 30.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Ball cost in the bat-ball problem: $0.05\n",
       "  - Let ball = x, bat = x+1; 2x+1 = 1.10 → 2x = 0.10 → x = 0.05.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Time for trains to be 240 miles apart: 16/7 hours ≈ 2 hours 17 minutes\n",
       "  - Relative speed = 60 + 45 = 105 mph; time = 240/105 = 16/7 hours ≈ 2.29 h (~2 h 17 m).\n",
       "\n",
       "- Distinct arrangements for BALLOON: 1260\n",
       "  - Letters: B×1, A×1, L×2, O×2, N×1 → 7!/(2!2!) = 5040/4 = 1260.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Day today if the day after tomorrow is two days before Thursday: Sunday\n",
       "  - Two days before Thursday is Tuesday; if day after tomorrow is Tuesday, today is Sunday.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Diagonals in a convex hexagon: 9\n",
       "  - Formula: n(n−3)/2 for n=6 → 6×3/2 = 9.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Area increase when side length is doubled: factor 4\n",
       "  - Area scales with the square of the linear dimension: (2)^2 = 4.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Third angle in the triangle: 70 degrees\n",
       "  - Sum is 180: 180 − (45 + 65) = 70.\n",
